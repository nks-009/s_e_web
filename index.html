                Entrepreneurs, freelancers and self-employed people work for themselves. They own or run their own
                business, which can be anything from a simple one-man band providing services such as dog-walking,
                decorating, or professional services, right up to a company established to produce and market a new
                piece of technology developed by the owner.

                Entrepreneurs and self-employed people are likely to share some common traits and skills. For
                example,
                they are often very self-disciplined, and happy to turn their hands to a wide range of tasks.
                Although
                they may well have Leadership and Management Skills, they also have other skills that may be less
                important for those working in large organisations under contracts of employment.
